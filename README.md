This will be a simple IRC bot for managing your channel

## Setup

To run this IRC bot you will need some depedencies if you are running this as a script and not as a compiled version. (Running as compliled version is a lot easier , however you might have to trust me that I am providing a proper compiled version of this bot).

These are the following depedencies you need to have before you could run this:

* **OS** : Preferably Linux , However one could run this in windows too. (I will provide the instructions of it later.)
* **Programming Language** : You will need python 3 to run this as a script.
* **Other tools** : Apart from this basic stuff , you would need pip3 , pipenv, and virtualenvwrapper.


### Installing python 3 in GNU/Linux debian and its derivatives

First confirm that you have python 3 in your system or not :

```
$ python3 --version
```
If you have it should give an output as such:

```
Python 3.6.6
```

If you don't have python 3 we have to go ahead and start installing python 3 . One could do this easily via running this command in the terminal:

```
$ sudo apt install python3

```

Or if you have some older version of distro try this :

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```
